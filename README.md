###Summary   
The goal of the project of data visualization was to acquant viewers with the ski opportunities in the State Salzburg, Austria to help them choose next ski destination easier.   
I've collected some key information about the ski resorts and put them on the map which should help perceive information about many different places smoothly.   
   
###Design   
To create the visualization such technologies as d3.js v.3 and TopoJSON were used.   
I've decided to use TopoJson because it gives more opportunities for merge map elements than GeoJSON.   
In the visualization 2 TopoJSON maps (Austria, counties - states and Austria, counties - local communities) were used.   
Statistical information about night spent by the tourists during the winter season 2015 belongs to http://www.statistik.at/. Key information about ski areas was gathered from http://www.salzburgerland.com/.   
In the project I've used different visualization elements such as: maps, rectangles, donut chart, bullet chart, etc.   
   
###Feedback   
While I've gotten warm feedbacks from many people, most often there were ideas to add some additional information which is important to make a decision for the individuals. In my project I've gathered experience of getting information from the different sources and, as there is no limit of perfection, I've left any additional information out of the scope of this project.
